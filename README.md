ParsecSDR is a software-defined radio inspired by the project FreeRSP (http://electronics.kitchen/misc/freesrp/). It consists of a PCB with a radio transceiver IC, and an FPGA with digital signal processing functionality. The FPGA acts as a signal processing modem, which # receives discrete signals from an LMS7002M transceiver. The FPGA also relays the data to a computer.

Currently, I have a wiki with electronics/digital signal processing notes, and a schematic for the PCB.
